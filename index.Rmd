## Filtering Columns and Rows

With SQL, you can filter columns and rows by using SELECT and WHERE. Let's look at an example using ther Lahman database. So we should first load that database, along with the package sqldf.

```{r message=FALSE, warning=FALSE}
library(Lahman)
library(sqldf)
```

Suppose now i would like to see the homerun totals for the 1927 Yankees. I could write the folowing query: 

```{r}
query<-"SELECT playerID,yearID,teamID,HR FROM Batting
WHERE teamID='NYA'and yearID=1927"
sqldf(query)
```


## ORDER BY 

With SQL we can order the rows of our output. Forinstance, suppose you want to see every instance of a player hitting more than 50 homeruns. BUt we want the player with the most homeruns to be at the top. we could use:

```{r}
query<-"SELECT playerID,teamID,yearID,HR FROM Batting
WHERE HR>50
ORDER BY HR DESC"

sqldf(query)
```
